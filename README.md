🛡️ Why PortlockWindows?

Many Windows systems are vulnerable through unnecessary open ports. Traditional port-blocking tools often break essential functionality or prevent online gaming. PortlockWindows provides enterprise-grade security while ensuring:

    Online games continue to work
    Windows updates function normally
    System stability is maintained

📋 Requirements

    Windows 10/11
    Python 3.7+ (automatically installed if missing)
    Administrator privileges

📝 Usage

After installation, PortlockWindows automatically applies security settings. If you experience any issues, run the restore script that's created on your desktop.

For advanced usage and configuration options, see the detailed usage guide.
🔧 Configuration

The default configuration works for most users, but you can customize settings by editing the config.json file in the installation directory.
